# 🐍 Python List Manipulation

## 📋 Project Overview

This repository contains a Python script designed to demonstrate advanced list manipulation techniques. It showcases the versatility of Python's built-in list data structure by performing a sequence of CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, sorting algorithms, and index querying.

This script serves as a concise reference for handling dynamic arrays in Python 3.

---

## 🔧 Technologies Used

* **Python 3.x** - Core programming language.

---

## 🚀 Key Operations Demonstrated

The script systematically performs the following logic flow:

1.  **Initialization:** Creating an empty dynamic list.
2.  **Appends:** Populating the list with initial integer data (`10`, `20`, `30`, `40`).
3.  **Insertion:** Injecting values at specific index positions (inserting `15` at index `1`).
4.  **Extension:** Merging another list (`[50, 60, 70]`) into the existing structure.
5.  **Deletion:** Removing the last element using the stack-like `.pop()` method.
6.  **Sorting:** Reordering the list in ascending order.
7.  **Querying:** locating the specific index of a target value (`30`).
